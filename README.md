Greetings, fellow data enthusiasts!

## Career Path
My career path has been an exciting one, and I've been fortunate enough to gain valuable experience in both software engineering and finance before finding my true calling in data analytics. For the past six years, I've been with Stax, a leading Global Mergers & Acquisition consulting firm, where I've helped clients unlock the full potential of their data.

My consulting experience at [Stax, LLC](https://www.stax.com) has taken me across various industries, including Academia, Healthcare, FMCGs, and Freight & Transport, where I've built data pipelines, developed ML models, and utilized data analytics to support strategic decision-making.

I've been in Data Science since 2014. But the past few years have been a fantastic journey, and I'm constantly amazed by the endless possibilities of data analytics. Each project presents a unique set of challenges, but the satisfaction of seeing a project come to life and knowing that the insights gained can make a real difference in the world makes it all worthwhile.
